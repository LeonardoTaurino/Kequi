# Equilibrium Constant Kequi
This Python extension will help you to calculate Kequi and some other thermodynamic for a particular reaction!
you can use data from the Perry and save them to a database so you have to write them only onece.

## Begining

## Calculate Kequi at a specif temperature
Just run the script  _Kequi_beta_2.0.0_, write the numer of substance in your reactionname and click _ok_. In the new window write the name of the substances (name or formula) and click on the _search_ button next to it to see if the substance is already on the database. If the chemical is not on the database then you have to put manually its parameter. surname of the person. If this person is already saved on the _birthday.txt_ file then you'll get his/her birthday otherwise you will be asked if you want to save his/her birthday on the same file.
