# Equilibrium Constant Kequi
This Python extension will help you to calculate Kequi and some other thermodynamic for a particular reaction!
you can use data from the Perry and save them to a database so you have to write them only onece.

## Begining

run the script  _Kequi_beta_2.0.0_, write the numer of substance in your reactionname and click _ok_. In the new window write the name of the substances and it stechiometric number (negative if it's a reagent, positive if it's a product). Then you can click on _search_ and if the substance is in the database then all the remainig field will auto complete otherwise you'll have to write manually each parameter required and then you can save this substance in the database clicking on _save_.

## Calculate Kequi at a specif temperature
After you inster all the substances you can write the temperature in the _final temperature_ entry and then click on _start_ to calculate the desired value.

---
## Make an iteration between a starting temperature and a final temperature. Build Kequi vs T graph
After you inster all the substances you can click on the _Iteration_ checkBox and write the starting temperature, final temperature and the step of the iteration. In the end the script will save the results on a txt file and it will automatically open an excel file with the results and a graph
